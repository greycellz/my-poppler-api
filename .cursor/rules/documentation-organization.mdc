# Documentation Organization Rule

## Important Note: Cursor Plan Mode vs Workspace Documentation

**Cursor Plan Mode Files** (`.cursor/plans/*.plan.md`):
- These are Cursor's internal plan files, managed by Cursor itself
- They are stored in `.cursor/plans/` directory (usually in home directory)
- These are separate from workspace documentation and are handled automatically by Cursor

**Workspace Documentation Files** (this rule applies to these):
- Documentation files created in the workspace root during development
- Review documents, analysis documents, implementation plans, etc.
- These should follow the organization rules below

## Planning and Review Files
- All workspace documentation files with patterns: *REVIEW*, *PLAN*, *ANALYSIS*, *FIX*, *SUMMARY*, *STATUS*, *COMPARISON*, *VERIFICATION*, *CODE_REVIEW*
- Should be created in `plan/` folder (workspace root, not `.cursor/plans/`)
- This folder is excluded from git tracking (via .gitignore)

## Strategic Documentation
- Files like README.md, setup guides, deployment guides, testing guides, etc.
- Should be kept in root directory
- Should be tracked in git (since git is not public)
- Patterns to keep: *SETUP*, *DESIGN*, *SCHEMA*, *ENHANCEMENT*, *DOCUMENTATION*, *METHODOLOGY*, *ROADMAP*, *STRATEGY*, *GUIDE*, *TESTING_GUIDE*, *TESTING_CHECKLIST*, *README*, *ROLLBACK_GUIDE*, *DEPLOYMENT*

## Essential Documentation
- README.md, setup guides, integration guides
- Should be tracked in git
- Keep in root directory

## File Organization Workflow

When creating new workspace documentation (NOT Cursor's plan mode files):

1. **If it's a temporary planning/review/analysis file:**
   - Create it in `plan/` folder (workspace root)
   - It will be automatically ignored by git
   - Example: `plan/FEATURE_X_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`

2. **If it's a strategic/setup/design/schema/enhancement document:**
   - Create it in root directory
   - It will be tracked in git
   - Example: `GEOLOCATION_SETUP.md`, `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`

3. **If it's essential documentation (README, setup guides):**
   - Create it in root directory
   - It will be tracked in git
   - Example: `README.md`, `TESTING_GUIDE.md`

**Note**: Cursor's plan mode files (`.cursor/plans/*.plan.md`) are managed separately by Cursor and are not affected by this rule.

## Examples

**Move to plan/:**
- `FEATURE_X_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- `BUG_FIX_REVIEW.md`
- `ANALYSIS_OF_ISSUE.md`
- `PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION_REVIEW.md`
- `TEST_RESULTS_*.md`

**Keep in root (tracked):**
- `README.md`
- `GEOLOCATION_SETUP.md`
- `RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md`
- `TESTING_GUIDE.md`
- `PHASE2C_ROLLBACK_GUIDE.md`
