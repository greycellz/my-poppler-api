# Railway Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide covers deploying the ChatterForms Railway backend with GCP integration to Railway.

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### **Automatic Deployment (Recommended)**
1. **GitHub Integration**: Railway automatically deploys when you push to your connected GitHub repository
2. **Docker Build**: Railway uses the `Dockerfile` to build and deploy your application
3. **Environment Variables**: Set required environment variables in Railway dashboard

### **Manual Deployment**
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your Railway project
railway link

# Deploy
railway up
```

## üîß Required Environment Variables

Set these in your Railway project dashboard:

### **GCP Configuration**
```env
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=chatterforms
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/chatterforms-app-key.json
```

### **Service Account Keys**
You need to add the service account key files to your Railway project:

1. **Go to Railway Dashboard** ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Variables
2. **Add the service account key content** as a variable:
   - Name: `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON`
   - Value: Copy the entire content of `chatterforms-app-key.json`

### **Optional Environment Variables**
```env
NODE_ENV=production
ENABLE_GCP_TEST=true  # Only if you want to test GCP integration
```

## üìã Pre-Deployment Checklist

### **‚úÖ Code Ready**
- [ ] GCP client module (`gcp-client.js`) implemented
- [ ] Service account keys available
- [ ] Dockerfile configured
- [ ] Health check endpoint working
- [ ] GCP test endpoint added

### **‚úÖ GCP Setup Complete**
- [ ] Service accounts created with proper permissions
- [ ] Firestore database created
- [ ] BigQuery tables created
- [ ] Cloud Storage buckets created
- [ ] KMS keys created

### **‚úÖ Railway Configuration**
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] Service account keys added
- [ ] Domain configured (if needed)

## üß™ Testing After Deployment

### **1. Health Check**
```bash
curl https://your-railway-domain.railway.app/health
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "pdf": "enabled",
    "screenshot": "enabled",
    "gcp": "enabled"
  },
  "environment": {
    "isRailway": true,
    "gcpProject": "chatterforms"
  }
}
```

### **2. GCP Integration Test**
```bash
curl https://your-railway-domain.railway.app/test-gcp
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "testResults": {
    "firestore": true,
    "storage": true,
    "kms": true,
    "bigquery": true
  },
  "environment": {
    "isRailway": true,
    "gcpProject": "chatterforms"
  }
}
```

### **3. Existing Endpoints**
- **PDF Upload**: `POST /upload`
- **Screenshot**: `POST /screenshot`
- **Cleanup**: `GET /cleanup`

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **1. GCP Authentication Errors**
```bash
# Check if service account key is accessible
curl https://your-railway-domain.railway.app/test-gcp
```

**Solution**: Verify `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS_JSON` environment variable is set correctly.

#### **2. Permission Errors**
```
Error: chatterforms-app@chatterforms.iam.gserviceaccount.com does not have permission
```

**Solution**: Check IAM permissions in GCP Console or run:
```bash
gcloud projects get-iam-policy chatterforms
```

#### **3. Service Not Starting**
```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs
```

**Solution**: Verify all environment variables are set and service account keys are valid.

### **Debug Commands**

#### **Check Railway Status**
```bash
railway status
railway logs
```

#### **Check Environment Variables**
```bash
railway variables
```

#### **Test Locally with Railway Environment**
```bash
railway run npm start
```

## üìä Monitoring

### **Railway Dashboard**
- **Deployments**: Track deployment history
- **Logs**: Real-time application logs
- **Metrics**: CPU, memory, network usage
- **Variables**: Environment variable management

### **GCP Console**
- **Firestore**: Database usage and queries
- **BigQuery**: Analytics data and queries
- **Cloud Storage**: File uploads and storage
- **KMS**: Encryption key usage
- **Logging**: Application logs and audit trails

## üîÑ Continuous Deployment

### **GitHub Integration**
1. **Connect Repository**: Link your GitHub repo to Railway
2. **Auto-Deploy**: Every push to main branch triggers deployment
3. **Preview Deployments**: Pull requests get preview deployments

### **Deployment Triggers**
- **Push to main**: Production deployment
- **Pull request**: Preview deployment
- **Manual**: Trigger deployment from Railway dashboard

## üö® Security Considerations

### **Service Account Keys**
- ‚úÖ **Never commit keys to Git**: Keys are in `.gitignore`
- ‚úÖ **Use Railway variables**: Store keys as environment variables
- ‚úÖ **Rotate keys regularly**: Update keys periodically
- ‚úÖ **Minimal permissions**: Use least privilege principle

### **Environment Variables**
- ‚úÖ **Production secrets**: Use Railway's secure variable storage
- ‚úÖ **No hardcoding**: All secrets in environment variables
- ‚úÖ **Access control**: Limit who can view/edit variables

## üìà Performance Optimization

### **Railway Resources**
- **CPU**: Monitor usage and scale if needed
- **Memory**: Watch for memory leaks
- **Network**: Optimize file uploads and API calls

### **GCP Optimization**
- **Firestore**: Use indexes for complex queries
- **BigQuery**: Batch insertions for better performance
- **Cloud Storage**: Use appropriate storage classes
- **KMS**: Cache encryption keys when possible

## üéØ Next Steps After Deployment

1. **‚úÖ Test all endpoints**: Verify everything works
2. **‚úÖ Monitor logs**: Watch for errors or issues
3. **‚úÖ Set up alerts**: Configure monitoring alerts
4. **‚úÖ Update Vercel**: Integrate with frontend
5. **‚úÖ Test end-to-end**: Full workflow testing
